# üó∫Ô∏è Maparium

**Maparium** is a lightweight and fast web application that provides real-time access to geospatial data across Poland. Built as a comprehensive GIS platform, it will offer multiple data layers including flood predictions, drought visualization, demographic data, and more - serving as a modern alternative to slow and difficult-to-use official portals.

Designed for everyday citizens, students, journalists, and curious minds. The official "Hydroportal", although feature-rich for GIS professionals and government officials, is way too slow and hard to read for spontaneous use. Maparium's mission is to make this GIS data as accessible and intuitive as possible.

Built with **React (TypeScript)** and **Vite**, it features a hybrid mapping setup that combines a **MapTiler** basemap with **custom geospatial data layers** served via a self-hosted **TileServer-GL** instance.

At its current demo stage, the app displays a fullscreen interactive map with expandable data layer functionality.
